<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Throughout my career, I have always been interested in how both technology and individuals interact with websites and the internet. I first started getting involved with this type of work while working in underwriting at Aetna. I began by testing our underwriting systems with our developers and providing daily reports about what's working and what's not. I tested various aspects of the system and eventually helped to implement our new system. From there, I left to pursue a Master's degree in Marketing Communication with an emphasis on Electronic Marketing. I knew I wanted to be involved in the internet, but was not sure how. In my new position, I took on the responsibilities of our website. I developed pages and kept content current. I then moved onto a larger website and focused all of my energy on SEO, social media strategy, and website development. My favorite project was the complete re-design of our site. Working with our Marketing & Communications team, I performed usability tests, created wireframes, and eventually moved our site into the new design. After this exciting project, I knew I needed to get more formal education in user experience and so began coursework in Information Architecture. This eventually led me to my new position at Roundarch Isobar as a User Experience Designer.</p>
