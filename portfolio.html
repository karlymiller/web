<h2>IIT Stuart School of Business Website</h2>
<p>In response to high bounce rates and inefficient navigation, I worked with the IIT Marketing and Communications Team to re-design our navigation and to ultimately re-design the look and feel of our entire site. We performed usability testing on prospective students, in the form of open house visitors and undergraduate recruits. We tested the current site and navigation. We then built wireframes and tested those. Once we were satisfied with a wireframe, we added design elements and tested that one last time. We then migrated the entire site from the prior design to the new design in our Site Studio system. I am proud to say that IIT has decided to adapt the design that I helped work on to the rest of their sites.</p>
